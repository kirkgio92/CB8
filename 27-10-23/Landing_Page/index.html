                    <h2>American Sniper</h2>
                    <p>American Sniper is a 2014 American biographical war drama film directed by Clint Eastwood and
                        written by Jason Hall. It is loosely based on the memoir American Sniper: The Autobiography of
                        the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History (2012) by Chris Kyle, with Scott McEwen and Jim
                        DeFelice. The film follows the life of Kyle, who became the deadliest marksman in U.S. military
                        history with 255 kills from four tours in the Iraq War, 160 of which were officially confirmed
                        by the Department of Defense. While Kyle was celebrated for his military successes, his tours of
                        duty took a heavy toll on his personal and family life. The film was produced by Eastwood,
                        Robert Lorenz, Andrew Lazar, Bradley Cooper, and Peter Morgan. It stars Cooper as Kyle and
                        Sienna Miller as his wife Taya, with Luke Grimes, Jake McDorman, Cory Hardrict, Kevin Lacz,
                        Navid Negahban, and Keir O'Donnell in supporting roles.</p>

                    <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
                    <p>Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan.
                        It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited
                        with being the "father of the atomic bomb" for his role in the Manhattan Project—the World War
                        II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography American
                        Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer,
                        with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project
                        during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing.</p>
